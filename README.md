## Description

Github is a cloud-based platform commonly used to host open-source
coding project… this workshop will introduce how it can be used more
broadly to back-up your research projects, collaborate within your lab
and with remote colleagues, and even practice open science by
(optionally) sharing your research project publicly.

*This workshop is open to everyone; NO previous experience with
programming/git/command-line is required.*

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

  - explain the benefits of version control
  - articulate the differences between `git` and `Github`
  - create and update repositories using Github Desktop and the Github
    website
  - write descriptive README files
  - select and apply a license to a GitHub project
