## Description

Github is a cloud-based platform commonly used to host open-source coding project... this workshop will introduce how it can be used more broadly to back-up your research projects, collaborate within your lab and with remote colleagues, and even practice open science by (optionally) sharing your research project publicly.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
* explain the benefits of version control
* articulate the differences between `git` and `Github`
* create and update repositories using Github Desktop and the Github website
* write descriptive README files
* select and apply a license to a GitHub project
